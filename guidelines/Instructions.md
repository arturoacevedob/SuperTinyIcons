# Guidelines

* **Green** is the safe zone, where the main body of the icon should be.
    
* **Yellow** is like a road shoulder, it's there if more space is needed. It should be used for protruding elements, like corners or ornaments.

* **Red** is off limits. It should not be touched by the icons. Red is also how a circular icon would look.

This is the standard guideline. It helps with sizing for both square and circle icons, so they would look good no matter what border radius is chosen.

## guideline for small squares.svg

This guideline solves visibility  problems with sizing for both squares and circles, where it might end up a bit small for good visibility when displayed at very, very small sizes in square form.

Needless to say, these are just guides. If they don't accommodate a certain shape, then they shouldn't be followed strictly.

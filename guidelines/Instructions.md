# Guidelines

This is the standard guideline. It helps with sizing for both square and circle icons, so they would look good no matter what border radius is chosen.

* **Green** is the safe zone, where the main body of the icon should be.
    
* **Yellow** is like a road shoulder, it's there if more space is needed. It should be used for protruding elements, like corners or ornaments.

* **Red** is off limits. It should not be touched by the icons. Red is also how a circular icon would look.

Needless to say, these are just guides. If they don't accommodate a certain shape, then they shouldn't be followed strictly.
